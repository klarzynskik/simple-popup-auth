> This project was bootstrapped using [LiveChat Developer Console CLI](https://github.com/livechat/dps-cli)

This app was created as the follow-up to the following blog post: [Stubbing OAuth Popup Authorization with Cypress](https://developers.livechat.com/).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Install dependecies

```sh
npm install
```

Start local development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open the Cypress App:

```
npm run cy:open
```

If you would like to correctly authorize outside of the Cypress tests, you need to set up your own LiveChat OAuth Client. You can learn more about that here: [Setup a LiveChat OAuth Client](https://developers.livechat.com/docs/authorization/sign-in-with-livechat#setup). Then, you should replace the `lcClientId` inside of the `/lib/config.ts` with the correct ClientID.
